# BS Partials

## Purpose and Meaning

BS Partials are nuggets of pre coded assets that can be used when styleing a web page with BS. The main bs file that contains all of the styles put together has not yet been created but once I get more done I will be sure to combine all of the partials into one file.

In case you only want some of the assets that BS has to offer you can download those partials you like and add them to your style sheet.
