# BS
beautiful_site is my very own CSS3 framework!  I know what your thinking _"Thats **'BS'**!_ You are right, it is!

## About
Since I started learning front-end Web Development I have found CSS fascinating never before had I felt so much fullfilment in writing code! Ever since I have been learning about it and extending my knowledge on it I have been trying my best to impliment best practice.

My intrest in Web Development hasn't stoped at front-end I am very passionate about full stack development in particular the MEAN stack. Learning back-end with nodejs and express has opened my mind up for even more possiblities, however as I have been learning via courses online I have found that most instructors that teach back end impliment a CSS framework such as bootsrap into thier courses. I have never wanted to learn bootstrap for two reasons:

  1. It is someone elses code
  1. I enjoy codeing my own styles

 I know of course that many people that work on backend love frameworks! I know they cut down on time, but I just think where is the fun in that.

 So that is my reasoning as to why I am creating this repo!

 ## Goals

  * The core goal is **Semantic Utility**
    * That means make it **USEFUL** and **Readable**
  * Next goal is to make it **Modular** and **Lightweight**
    * In other words there will be a lot to it but it is broken into pieces so you only have to download what you will use (similar to Semantic UI - another CSS framework) of course the complete file will also be avaliable
  * Dry - (don't repeat yourself) I will do my best to keep my code dry

  ## Current Version is bs 1.0
