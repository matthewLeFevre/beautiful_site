# BS
beautiful_site is my very own CSS3 framework!  I know what your thinking _"Thats **'BS'**!_ You are right, it is!

## About
Since I started learning front-end Web Development I have found CSS fascinating never before had I felt so much fullfilment in writing code! Ever since I have been learning about it and extending my knowledge on it I have been trying my best to impliment best practice.

Inspiration for BS stems from my passion for CSS in particular. The nameing convention for BS follows BEM naming in most cases that means it is relatively easy to read and understand although many class names have few meanings so memorizing what different class names do is your best bet at understand it.

My intrest in Web Development hasn't stoped at front-end I am very passionate about full stack development in particular the MEAN stack. Learning back-end with nodejs and express has opened my mind up for even more possiblities, however as I have been learning via courses online I have found that most instructors that teach back end impliment a CSS framework such as bootsrap into thier courses. I have never wanted to learn bootstrap for two reasons:

  1. It is someone elses code
  1. I enjoy codeing my own styles

 I know of course that many people that work on backend love frameworks! I know they cut down on time, but I just think where is the fun in that.

 So that is my reasoning as to why I am creating this framework!

 ## Goals

  * The core goal is **Semantic Utility**
    * That means make it **USEFUL** and **Readable**
  * Next goal is to make it **Modular** and **Lightweight**
    * In other words there will be a lot to it but it is broken into pieces so you only have to download what you will use (similar to Semantic UI - another CSS framework) of course the complete file will also be avaliable
  * Dry - (don't repeat yourself) I will do my best to keep my code dry

  ## Current Version is bs 1.0.1
