# BS Navigations

There is currently only one navigation option avaliable in BS but more are coming soon! I haven't named this navigation yet but it it very simple. Here is an explanation with code.

## HTML Code

```
<nav>
    <img class="n-image" src="(source rought for image)">
    <ul class="n-bar">
        <li class="n-bar-itm"><a href="(link location)" class="n-bar-a">Nav tab</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```
