  1. Vertical Thumnails (still working out querks)

## Info Thumbnails

Why arn't they just called horizontal thumnails? Well feel free to call them that truth is I think that info thumbnail better describes them because they display information about a specif entity or thing. Each thumbnail comes with a photo a title and some content regagrding the content and a "read more button" or anything you want to call the button.

Uses:

  1. List products
  1. Blog posts
  1. Accounts/Profiles
  1. Events
  1. Your imagination...

Here are some example blog posts advertised with the info thumbnails.

### Code example and image
